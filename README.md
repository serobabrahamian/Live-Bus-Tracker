# Live-Bus-Tracker

This project uses HTML, JavaScript, and an API (Aplication Programming Interface). We use Google Maps interface for this project and add markers on the real time buses going through the city of Boston, Massachusetts. With real time latitude and longitude, the code makes it possible to add markers to the map and see what is going on visually. Of course, this would need to be public information and thanks to MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transport Authority), the latitude and logitude of the buses are available to the public.
