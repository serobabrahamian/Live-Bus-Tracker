# Live-Bus-Tracker-App

This project uses HTML, JavaScript, and APIs (Application Programming Interface). We use Google Maps and its interface to show a live-feed of the buses in the Boston, Massachussetts area. Thanks to the Massachussetts Bay Transport Authority, the location of the buses are available through their web-site and come in object-form with latitude and longitude. Markers on the map are created and the user can track the buses visually by using all these tools together.

For this project you would need to create a Google Account and create an API key which you may then use to access their Maps on your web-site (up to a certain amount of fetches are free). So in JS document attached, you need to enter your own key for the project to work. Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide our personal key for you to use.

--Roadmap of Future Improvements

This project can evolve to include many different cities, all across the world and their public transportation system.
By moving throughout the map, the users can see all the different maps while tracking different buses and possibly even other methods of transportation such as metro and train.
